Tools for teaching computer science classes

## Submit
This tool is intended to be used as a setgid program. It is currently a work in progress.

Example executions:
```
/c/cs323/Hwk1/submit
/c/cs323/Hwk1/submit info
/c/cs323/Hwk1/submit info 1
/c/cs323/Hwk1/submit get
/c/cs323/Hwk1/submit get 1
```
## Grader
A python script to automatically build and run a set of student submitted code. I can calculate late scores, and handle Canvas gradebook csv files.
